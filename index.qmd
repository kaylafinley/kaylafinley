I am a graduate student in the Professional Science Master's Program in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University. I am focusing on Carbon Management. I have a passion for renewable energy implementation, environmental justice, and public engagement.

Through my work as an Outreach and Project Coordinator at the Energy Institute and Environmental Educator Intern at the Environmental Learning Center, I have learned the skills to communicate complex information about renewable energy, and environmental systems to the general public, with an emphasis on K - 12.
